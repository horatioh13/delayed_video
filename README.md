# Long Duration Delayed Video Application

This python script is designed to display video feeds with an adjustable delay of up to 24 hours. The program acomplishes this through sequentially recording images and dynamically displaying them based on the time stamp that they were recorded, so the delay is completely accurate.
The recorded images are stored on the  hard drive of the computer, not in RAM to allow for a very long delay, even on lightweight computers.
